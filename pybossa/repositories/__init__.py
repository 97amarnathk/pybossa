""" This package exports the following repository objects as an abstraction
layer between the ORM and the application:

    * user_repo
    * project_repo

The responsibility of these repositories is only fetching one or many objects of
a kind and/or saving them to the DB by calling the ORM apropriate methods.

For more complex DB queries, refer to other packages or services within PyBossa."""
